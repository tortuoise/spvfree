      <h1>SPV FREE</h1>
    <div id="textbox">
      <h2> Beginning in 2015, every quarter we will install 100KW of solar PV systems on residential and commercial rooftops. When you register, one of our engineers will visit your site to check suitability and your current electricity consumption. We're looking for large unshaded roof tops on houses and offices. Depending on the roof space and quality available, we'll offer you a certain number of units of electricity free every month in exchange for allowing us to install the system.  </h2>
      </br></br>
      <h2> Over time we expect this model to evolve into an auction based one where customers bid for the number of units they want free, with the lowest number of units winning.</h2>
